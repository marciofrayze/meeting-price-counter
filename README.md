# Meeting Price Counter

See the web app in action at: [https://meeting-price-counter.firebaseapp.com/](https://meeting-price-counter.firebaseapp.com/)

**This is a work in progress. No css yet.**

## What is it?

As the name implies, this is a simple web app where you can count how much money is being spent on a meeting.
Just insert how many people are in the meeting, what is the average salary and click in start counting.

## Why?

This project was created so I could test the [hyperapp](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hyperapp) framework 
and [parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel) bundler.

## How to start the server locally
```
git clone git@github.com:mfdavid/meeting-price-counter.git
cd meeting-price-counter
npm install  
npm start
```
